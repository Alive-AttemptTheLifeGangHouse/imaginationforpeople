"\t\t\tWe believe in the civic imagination, or imagination for the common "
"good. Our filter is practical - or applied - creativity.<br /><br />\n"
"\t\t\tWe believe in the collective, cumulative and collaborative process of "
"invention. The civic imagination concerns everyone and is accessible to us "
"all. In our opinion, ingenuity is a necessary condition for social "
"engagement.<br /><br />\n"
"\t\t\tWe believe in a pragmatic definition of creativity, one that can be "
"easily applied to social issues at a local and human level. For example, in "
"response to climate change, a problem seen by many as too large and "
"abstract, we prefer a finer granularity (collective transportation, "
"sustainable habitat, etc…). We believe that this granularity makes creative "
"initiatives more spontaneous and functional.<br /><br />\n"
"\t\t\tWe believe in stories narrated by anonyms: individuals, collectives of "
"citizens, associations, businesses, who invent, test and perfect on-the-"
"ground, ingenious and often modest solutions that never make it to the "
"media. Imagination for people is, in its way, a mechanism for unearthing "
"ideas & insights and making them meaningful.<br /><br />\n"
"\t\t\tWe believe in the virtue of pilot projects: our heros are those "
"individuals who attempt, everywhere on earth, to develop local solutions "
"with an entrepreneurial spirit. These are doers, first and foremost.<br /"
"><br />\n"
"\t\t\tWe believe in creative acupuncture. For us, this means selecting "
"symbolic projects of often modest size that help move us all forward by "
"enhancing how we live together.<br /><br />\n"
"\t\t\tWe believe in Romain Rolland’s formulation, which we adapt and adopt : "
"« to join the pessimism of experience with the optimism of invention”.<br /"
"><br />\n"
"\t\t\tWe believe in transdisciplinarity, which in our opinion means a "
"unique, counter-intuitive, disarming, provoking and transgressive approach. "
"We believe in building bridges: architecture meets health, finance meets the "
"social sphere, design meets ecology….<br /><br />\n"
"\t\t\tWe believe in humour, which is vital to a free spirit. Humour is an "
"active and liberating form of imagining. IP aspires to be a fun platform, "
"one that can mobilize and excite people.<br /><br />\n"
"\t\t\tWe believe in the need for a transition space that helps us all move "
"from civic imagination to civic action, from inspiration to perspiration."
"<br /><br />\n"
"\t\t\tWe believe in the necessity to invent new terms around social "
"innovation. This requires a renewed alphabet, the ability to connect "
"apparently unrelated issues and to proceed by inspiring associations. We "
"call this capacity the imaginative paths, to which we dedicate Imagination "
"for People.<br /><br />\n"
