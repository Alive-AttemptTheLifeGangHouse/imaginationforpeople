/***
 * IMPORTANT : CONSTANTS NAMING SCHEME
 *
 * The naming scheme is simple, your constants name must follow this rule :
 * "<typename>[<Targetname>]<Attributename>"
 * 
 * - <typename> could be "color", "size", "font", etc.
 *
 * - <targetname> is optional and could be any targetable CSS objects or
 *   properties like "text", "border", etc. 
 *
 * - <attributename> is a meaningful description of your constant, like "Blue",
 *   "LightBlue", "Small", "Huge", etc.
