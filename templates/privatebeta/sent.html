			We believe in the civic imagination, or imagination for the common good. Our filter is practical - or applied - creativity.<br /><br />
			We believe in the collective, cumulative and collaborative process of invention. The civic imagination concerns everyone and is accessible to us all. In our opinion, ingenuity is a necessary condition for social engagement.<br /><br />
			We believe in a pragmatic definition of creativity, one that can be easily applied to social issues at a local and human level. For example, in response to climate change, a problem seen by many as too large and abstract, we prefer a finer granularity (collective transportation, sustainable habitat, etcâ€¦). We believe that this granularity makes creative initiatives more spontaneous and functional.<br /><br />
			We believe in stories narrated by anonyms: individuals, collectives of citizens, associations, businesses, who invent, test and perfect on-the-ground, ingenious and often modest solutions that never make it to the media. Imagination for people is, in its way, a mechanism for unearthing ideas & insights and making them meaningful.<br /><br />
